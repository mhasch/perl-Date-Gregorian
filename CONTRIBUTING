If your contribution is accepted, you will be mentioned by name under

Development Guidelines
----------------------

This library is intended as a more object-oriented replacement for
Date::Calc, or for the subset of DateTime that deals with just dates
rather than dates and times.  It should correctly and efficiently
implement the Gregorian calendar with very few prerequisites.

Topics of interest
------------------

Some of the plans for the library are outlined in the ROADMAP section
of the main documentation.

Other improvements could help the documentation to be clearer, or more
complete, or better formatted.  And, of course, there is always room
for cool examples and references to application modules.

Author's Note
-------------

Thanks again for your interest.
I am looking forward to your report or e-mail.
